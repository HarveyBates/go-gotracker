Go-gotracker provides a self-hosted resource for analysing workouts and athletic performance over time. There are three main aims:
1. Eliminate the possibility of losing workout data - hence self-hosting 
2. Make it easier to stay on track with your training - through custom graphs and analytics
3. Provide some level of direction in what future workouts should entail

The current version relies heavily on [Strava](www.strava.com) (thanks to their awesome API) for pulling in an athletes data. From here a number of metrics are generated, which are based on numerous resources linked below.
